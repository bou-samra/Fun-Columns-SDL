# Fun Columns SDL

## Description:
The aim of this project is to implement the original Free Tools Association (FTA) version of their Fun Columns game in SDL.

For those who may not have heard of the Free Tools Association (FTA) and their influence within the Apple IIGS community many
decades ago, a [website](http://www.freetoolsassociation.com/) is still maintained by Olivier Goguel (one of the original members of the group).

<b>Please Note:</b> This source code is very much in a state of flux and is currently a bit of a mess.
I will provide updates as best as I can :smile:
